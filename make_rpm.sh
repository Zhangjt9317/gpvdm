%description
General-purpose solar cell device model, is a drift-diffusion/Shockley-Read-Hall
solar cell simulator specifically developed for the simulation of 1st, 2nd and
3rd generation solar cells.  It can simulate light/dark JV curves, charge
extraction data and provide information on average recombination rates (tau)
as would be measured from transient photo-voltage experiments.
