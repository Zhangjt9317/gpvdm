What is gpvdm?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gpvdm is a free organic solar cells model. It is specifically designed to simulate bulk-heterojuncton organic solar cells, such as those based on the P3HT:PCBM material system. The model contains both an electrical and an optical solver, enabling both current/voltage characteristics to be simulated as well as the optical modal profile within the device. The model and it's easy to use graphical interface is available for both Linux and Windows.
The model can simulate:

    *Dark JV curves
    *Light JV curves
    *Dark CELIV transients
    *Light CELIV transients
    *Voltage transients of an arbitrary shape
    *Full optical model taking into account reflection at interfaces and absorption.
    *Calculation of reflection profile
    *Ability to simulate OLEDs

The physical model solves both electron and hole drift-diffusion, and carrier continuity equations in position space to describe the movement of charge within the device. The model also solves Poisson's equation to calculate the internal electrostatic potential. Recombination and carrier trapping are described within the model using a Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) formalism, the distribution of trap sates can be arbitrarily defined. A fuller description of the model can be found in the at www.opvdm.com, in the associated publications and in the manual.
Example simulations

The model makes it easy to study the influence of material parameters such as mobility, energetic disorder, doping and recombination cross-sections on device performance. All internal device parameters such as current density, charge density, distribution of trapped carriers in position and energy space are accessible either through the graphical interface or directly through output files. 


Help using opvdm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm very happy to provide help in using OPVDM, or if you wold prefer I am equally happy to collaborate and model your data for you. See the contact page.

History of opvdm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I wrote the original version of opvdm during the very exciting time I spent working at Imperial College for Jenny Nelson - see the publication list.  Since that time, I have improved and rewritten large parts of the model to make the code base more sane/accessible/useful to others.
