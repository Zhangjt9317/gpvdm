Description: Provides gpvdm a tool for simulating and solar cells.
 It was originally written to model organic solar cells and OLEDs,
 but it has recently been extended to simulate other devices
 including silicon based devices. Currently the model can simulate;
 Organic solar cells; Organic LEDs; Crystalline silicon solar cells
 (beta); a-Si solar cells (beta) and CIGS solar cells (alpha).
 .
 The model can simulate: Dark JV curves; Light JV curves ; Dark/Light
 CELIV transients; Dark/Light photo-CELIV transients; Transient Photo
 Current (TPC); Transient Photo Voltage (TPV) ; Impedance Spectroscopy
 (IS); Voltage transients of an arbitrary shape; Full optical model taking into
 account reflection at interfaces and absorption and calculation of
 reflection profile
 .
 The physical model solves both electron and hole drift-diffusion, and
 carrier continuity equations in position space to describe the movement
 of charge within the device. The model also solves Poisson's equation
 to calculate the internal electrostatic potential. Recombination and
 carrier trapping are described within the model using a Shockley-Read-Hall
 (SRH) formalism, the distribution of trap sates can be arbitrarily defined.
 All equations can be solved either in steady state or in time domain.
